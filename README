# Configuration
Rjiffy::Configuration.configure do |conf|
  conf.token = "somevalidtoken"
end

# Find all boxes
boxes = Rjiffy::Box.all

# Find one box

box.delete


# TODO
- Handle Errors and Messages from the api response
  ( Log messages when no error, i.e. thaw a box )
  ( Raise Exeption with message when error, i.e. no token exist, but the
    response looks the same when no box with id X found. Only the message text
    itself is different, the type for both is 'error'
  )
